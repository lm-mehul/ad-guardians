ad-guardians - Maintaining Ad Quality

# Problem Statement
Ad quality is critical for publishers, especially with the rise of programmatic advertising, which complicates quality control over advertisers, ad units, and creatives. Idea is to develop an ad-quality tool by leveraging ML and predict if an ad is likely to be “bad”(inappropriate, objectionable content, etc.) before it shows up on publishers’ sites. This allows us to take action preemptively.
- ML scans ads in real-time, classifies harmful content (e.g., inappropriate, violent), and blocks it preemptively.
- Continuously trains on new datasets to enhance accuracy and reduce manual intervention.
- We'll also look at which DSPs or buyers have this type of creative, and flag them to block in future, based on historical trends. In this way, ML also helps with brand safety.
